	<!-- GENERAL INFORMATION: If you are unsure of anything, please use the LT Discord to ask for help!
	Your clothing's id (which is very important to the game), is calculated from your clothing's folder and .xml name using the following code:
		modAuthorDirectory.getName()+"_"+innerChild.getParentFile().getName()+"_"+innerChild.getName().split("\\.")[0]
	This results in this particular item's id being: "innoxia_rentalMommy_rental_mommy".
	IMPORTANT: If you ever change the name of this .xml, or containing folder, any items of this clothing that exist in the game will be removed!-->

				The 'id' element should be unique to stickers within this category element.
				The 'priority' variable determines the position of this sticker in UI rendering order (in the inventory's clothing dye screen), with lower values being rendered nearer to the left of the buttons list.
				'defaultSticker' defines whether this sticker is applied to this clothing item by default when spawned in.
				'zLayer' defines the rendering z-layer priority. These 'zLayer' values are compared against one another when rendering, with higher values being drawn on top of stickers with lower values. *The base svg has a zLayer value of 0*, meaning that negative values will be drawn beneath the base svg. Defining zLayer as 0 is not advised (although it is handled by always being drawn on top of the base layer).
				'colourDisabled' and 'colourSelected' are optional variables which you can use to define the colour of the text within the button used to select this sticker in the clothing dye UI. You can leave these blank or delete them entirely to use default button colours. The default values, if you were to define them using these variables, would look like:
				colourDisabled="TEXT_GREY" colourSelected="GENERIC_GOOD"
				(Note: If you do not define an 'imageName' variable, or if you leave it blank, the default selected colour will be TEXT_GREY instead of GENERIC_GOOD.)

					<stickerName><![CDATA[Patched]]></stickerName>
					<namePrefix priority="1"><![CDATA[Patched ]]></namePrefix> <!-- Define a 'namePrefix' to add a prefix to the base clothing's name when this sticker is applied.
					The 'priority' variable defines the order in which multiple sticker 'namePrefix's are displayed. A *lower value* means they will be *displayed first*. This can be left undefined. -->
					<namePostfix/> <!-- Exactly the same as 'namePrefix', but the text is appended after the base clothing name. -->
					<descriptionModification fullReplacement="false" priority="1"><![CDATA[<i> This one has been repeatedly patched up, and you don't even want to think about the stains.</i>]]></descriptionModification> <!-- You can set whether this sticker should define a new description for the clothing.
					If 'fullReplacement' is true, then the clothing's description is completely replaced with 'descriptionModification' while this sticker is applied. If 'fullReplacement' is false, then it is appended to the base clothing description (so long as another sticker has not applied a 'fullReplacement').
					The 'priority' element defines in what order the description appending is performed, or, if 'fullReplacement' is true for multiple active stickers, which sticker's description has priority. -->
					<imageName>rtunic_st_ragged.svg</imageName> <!-- The path name for this sticker, which should be in the same folder location as this xml file.
					The 'slot' variable can be omitted, in which case the default slot for the clothing item is used.
					If the clothing can be equipped into multiple slots, you don't *need* to define an 'imageName' element for every slot, but if you don't, the game will end up using any of your defined 'imageName's at random (which is not a problem if you only define one 'imageName' that's suitable for any of the clothing's base imageName).-->
					<itemTagsAdded/> <!-- If this sticker should add any ItemTags to the clothing, then you can define them in here. Use <tag> elements within the 'itemTagsAdded' element (e.g. <tag>SOLD_BY_NYAN</tag>)using ItemTag names as defined here: https://github.com/Innoxia/liliths-throne-public/blob/dev/src/com/lilithsthrone/game/inventory/ItemTag.java -->
					<itemTagsRemoved/> <!-- If this sticker should remove any ItemTags to the clothing, then you can define them in here. Use <tag> elements in the same manner as 'itemTagsAdded'. (Warning: If you define either a single sticker or multiple stickers to have conflicting tag behaviour (i.e. both adding and removing identical tags), then behaviour is undefined and you will end up with the ItemTag applied or removed at random.) -->
					<unavailabilityText/> <!-- Sticker are available to be used by the player by default, but if you want there to be requirements for using this sticker, then define this element as a CDATA text element, with any non-whitespace text returned signalling to the game that this sticker is unavailable. The returned text will be displayed to the player in the button's tooltip, so it should describe why this sticker is unavailable.
					You can define a 'showDisabledButton' attribute, which by default is set to true, and which defines whether or not this sticker's selection button is shown to the player when disabled.
					Please note that no 'npc' tag can be used, as this clothing might not belong to anyone.
					
					An example where the player could only use the sticker while being feminine would be:
					<unavailabilityText showDisabledButton="true"><![CDATA[
						#IF(!pc.isFeminine())
							Only feminine characters can apply this sticker!
						#ENDIF
					]]></unavailabilityText>
					
					And for this example, the disabled button is not shown to the player, so there's no need for an elaborate description, as the player will never see it:
					<unavailabilityText showDisabledButton="false"><![CDATA[
						#IF(pc.getSubspeciesOverrideRace()!=RACE_DEMON && !pc.isFeminine())
							unavailable
						#ENDIF
					]]></unavailabilityText>
					-->
					<availabilityText>
						If you really want that vintage look...
					</availabilityText> <!-- The counterpart to 'unavailabilityText', this text is shown when 'unavailabilityText' is returning an empty String, and therefore this sticker is available. Use a CDATA text element.
					Counterpart examples to the two above:
					<availabilityText><![CDATA[
						You have unlocked this sticker due to being feminine!
					]]></availabilityText>
					
					<availabilityText><![CDATA[
						#IF(pc.getSubspeciesOverrideRace()==RACE_DEMON)
							You have unlocked this sticker due to being a demon!
						#ELSE
							You have unlocked this sticker due to being feminine!
						#ENDIF
					]]></availabilityText>

		<!-- Your clothing can be coloured any way you like, but if you'd like the player to be able to dye your clothing, you can specify available colours here. primaryColours, secondaryColours, and tertiaryColours can all spawn in as a default colour, while their 'Dye' counterparts are only available if the player chooses to dye the clothing in that colour. The game detects specific colour values, and recolours them to the value chosen by the player. These values are as follows:
		Red is used as base colour for changing the primary colour of the graphic in-game, and the game will only recognise and change the following colours:
			#ff2a2a
			#ff5555
			#ff8080
			#ffaaaa
			#ffd5d5
		Orange is used as base colour for changing the secondary colour of the graphic in-game, and the game will only recognise and change the following colours:
			#ff7f2a
			#ff9955
			#ffb380
			#ffccaa
			#ffe6d5
		Yellow is used as base colour for changing the tertiary colour of the graphic in-game, and the game will only recognise and change the following colours:
			#ffd42a
			#ffdd55
			#ffe680
			#ffeeaa
			#fff6d5
		ANY GRADIENTS THAT YOU USE SHOULD BE CALLED: "innoGrad1", "innoGrad2", etc.
